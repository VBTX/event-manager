# In the first line weâ€™re pointing our root route to http://localhost:3000/events, 
# this is purely for aesthetic reasons. However in the four lines that follow, 
# you can see that we are informing Rails about the routes we will be using in our React application. 
# This is important, as otherwise if a user requested any of these routes directly 
# (by refreshing the page, for example), Rails would know nothing about them and would respond with a 404. 
# Doing things this way means that Rails can simply serve our React app and let it work out which view to display.
